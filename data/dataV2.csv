Hip-Hop, started out in the heart Yo, now everybody tryin to chart C'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon, uhh C'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon [Chorus] C'mon baby light my fire Everything you drop is so tired Music is supposed to inspire How come we ain't gettin no higher? [Verse 1] Now tell me your philosophy On exactly what an artist should be Should they be someone with prosperity And no concept of reality? Now, who you know without any flaws? That lives above the spiritual laws? And does anything they feel just because There's always someone there who'll applaud? [Chorus] C'mon baby light my fire Everything you drop is so tired Music is supposed to inspire How come we ain't gettin no higher? [Verse 2] I know you think that you've got it all And by making other people feel small Makes you think you're unable to fall But when you do, who you gonna call? See what you give is just what you get I know it hasn't hit you yet! Now I don't mean to get you upset But every cause has an effect! Uh-huh! [Chorus] C'mon baby light my fire Everything you drop is so tired Music is supposed to inspire How come we ain't gettin no higher? [Verse 3] I cross sands in distant lands, made plans with the sheiks Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak? Uhh All I wanted was to sell like five hundred And be a ghetto superstar since my first album, Blunted I used to work at Foot Locker, they fired me: I fronted Or I quitted, now I spit it -- however do you want it? Now you get it! Writing rhymes, in the Range, with the frames slightly tinted Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented (Lauryn Hill!) And if your lines sound like mine I'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!) Unprecedented, and still respected when it's vintage I'm serious, I'm takin over areas in Aquarius Runnin' red lights with my ten thousand chariots Just as Christ was a Superstar, you stupid, star! They'll hail you then nail you, no matter who you are They'll make you now then take you down, and make you face it If you slit the bag open, put your pinky in it and taste it [Chorus] C'mon baby light my fire Everything you drop is so tired Music is supposed to inspire How come we ain't gettin no higher? C'mon baby light my fire Everything you drop is so tired Music is supposed to inspire How come we ain't gettin no higher? C'mon baby light my fire Everything you drop is so tired Music is supposed to inspire How come we ain't gettin no higher?"
